# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a fully static, single-page premium web development studio website for Digitalamiro with a cohesive black/white/charcoal + amber accent design system.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement global design system: #0A0A0A, #FFFFFF, #1C1C1E palette with #C9A96E accent, large serif/geometric sans display headings (64–80px), 8px spacing grid, smooth scroll, and CSS transitions on all interactive elements
- Build sticky navbar with Digitalamiro wordmark, 7 nav links, backdrop blur on scroll, and "Book a Strategy Call →" CTA
- Build Hero section: two-column layout with label, bold headline, two paragraphs, 5 checkmark bullet points, two CTAs, and hero mockup image on the right
- Build Positioning section (dark background): large headline "Most Websites Exist. Few Actually Perform." with four impact statements and closing paragraph
- Build Services section (light background): three-column card grid for Custom Web Design, Performance-Ready Websites, and eCommerce Development — each with subheadline, bullets, border, hover lift, and CTA
- Build Process section: 5-step horizontal stepper (desktop) / vertical (mobile) with step numbers, titles, descriptions, and connecting line
- Build About section (dark background): headline, studio description, three styled guiding principles, and closing contrast statement
- Build "Who We Work With" section (light background): four client type statements and italicized qualifier copy
- Build Investment section: large "₹1,50,000+" price display, supporting copy, and CTA button
- Build FAQ accordion: 4 items, one open at a time, animated open/close with chevron indicator
- Build final CTA section (dark background): headline, tagline, three clarity lines, large CTA button, mailto email link, and location
- Build minimal three-column footer (dark background) with wordmark, services list, quick links, and copyright bar with Privacy Policy and Terms links
- Load hero mockup image from `/assets/generated/hero-mockup.dim_900x640.png` with drop shadow and rounded corners

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse a single scrollable, premium studio marketing page for Digitalamiro — covering services, process, about, pricing, FAQ, and contact — with a polished dark/light alternating layout and smooth interactive elements.
