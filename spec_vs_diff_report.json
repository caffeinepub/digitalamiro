  "summary": "The diff implements nearly all requirements comprehensively. All 13 REQs are addressed with matching components. Minor gaps exist: the navbar 'Insights' link maps to '#positioning' while the section uses id='positioning' not id='insights'. Internet Identity authentication is included despite the spec explicitly listing no authentication as a non-goal. A caffeine.ai attribution link is added to the footer without being requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "REQ-2: Navbar 'Insights' link should scroll to a section identifiable as Insights — the spec lists 7 nav links including 'Insights' each scrolling to their respective sections",
      "reason": "The navbar maps 'Insights' to href='#positioning' and the App.tsx section uses id='positioning', not id='insights'. While it navigates somewhere, there is no section with id='insights' as would be expected from the spec's nav structure.",
